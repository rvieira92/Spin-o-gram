# Spin-o-gram

**Spin-o-gram** is a simple portable Python-based GUI tool for **visualizing and preparing plots of spin distributions** from [UppASD](https://github.com/UppASD/UppASD) simulations.
For advanced analysis and visualisation, we recommend the SpinView package (https://github.com/mxjk851/spinview)

## 📦 Features

* Visualize radial histograms of spin moments from `restart.simid.out` files
* Visualize total distribution or projected by the magnitude of the magnetic moment (or by site)
* Interactive and user-friendly GUI (Tkinter)
* Customizable plots

## 🚀 Quick Start

To launch the GUI, navigate to the folder containing your `restart.simid.out` file and run:

```bash
python spin-o-gram.py
```

## ⚙️ Command Line Usage

```bash
python spin-o-gram.py [-h] [--file FILE] [--nsites NSITES] [--NDIV NDIV]
```

### Options

| Argument                       | Description                                                          |
| ------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `-h`, `--help`                 | Show help message and exit                                           |
| `-f FILE`, `--file FILE`       | Path to `restart.*.out` file generated by UppASD                     |
| `-s NSITES`, `--nsites NSITES` | Number of atomic sites, must match posfile (changes projection mode) |
| `--NDIV NDIV`                  | Number of bins for radial angle division                             |

## 🧱 Dependencies

* `numpy`
* `matplotlib`
* **Tkinter** (native library included with most Python installations)

> 💡 **Note**: The GUI is built with Tkinter to ensure maximum portability. It works well even through SSH with X11 forwarding enabled. No additional remote setup steps required.
